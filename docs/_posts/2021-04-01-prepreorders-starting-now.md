Yes, you've read that right, *only today*, you can preorder your right to actually preorder this free2play game at a later point in time¹.
<br><sub>**¹**When will that point in time be? How should I know, take a look at our messy roadmap and pray that it won't take until next year's April Fool's day!</sub>

`*Ahem*` Either way, preorder your right to preorder the game now, so you'll be able to play the game for free once it launches²!
<br><sub>**²**Just like everyone else, but shush, give us your money!</sub>

As an *exclusive* pre-preorder bonus, you'll receive this virtual roll of toilet paper in order to prepare yourself for the next lockdown: 🧻³
<br><sub>**³**Ever given they arrive at all.</sub>

So what are you waiting for? [Pre-preorder today🡕](https://bit.ly/3sysbYZ) and get yourself that fancy roll of toilet paper before this **very** unique offer is *gone forever*!
